# Game of Life
Embedded system programming project in `C++` involving skills in programming and electronics.

The project consisted in the development of the famous one player *"Game of Life"* with some extra features like velocity control and soundtrack added to the project. The game was displayed in a **LCD screen** and the speed of the algorithm was controlled by a **potentiometer**. Every time the game was reset it would respawn the cells in a random position. Furthermore, other variations were added such as connecting the walls of the canvas (changing therefore how the cells interact) or adding music to the project with a buzzer.

This was one of my first programming projects. ðŸŽ‰

### Instructions

If you would like to read the main code for running the project, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/Randulfe/Game-of-Life/blob/master/Game_of_life/main.cpp). The rest of the files in the [project folder](https://github.com/Randulfe/Game-of-Life/tree/master/Game_of_life) are mainly low level libraries for interacting with the LCD screen, the sounds to be played with the buzzer and the library to intect with the device. The microcontroller must be a mbed aae6fcc7d9bb.
